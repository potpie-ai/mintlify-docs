# Code Changes Agent

The Code Changes Agent specializes in generating detailed analysis of code changes in your current branch compared to the default branch. This agent works best with Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript codebases.

## Capabilities

- Identify APIs impacted by current changes
- Analyze cascading effects of code modifications
- Review changes and suggest improvements

## How to Use

To utilize the Code Changes Agent, you can ask questions or request analysis related to your current code changes. Here are some example prompts:

1. "Which APIs are impacted by my current change?"
2. "Help me understand any cascading effects of my changes."
3. "Review my changes and suggest improvements."

## Best Practices

- Provide context about the changes you've made when asking for analysis
- Be specific about the parts of the code you want to focus on
- Use the agent's suggestions as a starting point for your own review and decision-making process

By leveraging the Code Changes Agent, you can gain valuable insights into the impact of your code modifications and ensure higher quality changes before merging them into your main codebase.
