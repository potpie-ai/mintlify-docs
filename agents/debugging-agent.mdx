The Debugging with Knowledge Graph Agent is designed to analyze stacktraces and errors, relating them to your specific codebase. This agent provides debugging directions, adds print debugging statements, and helps you iteratively find the root cause of issues.

## Capabilities

- Analyze error messages and stacktraces
- Provide debugging directions based on your codebase
- Add print debugging statements to relevant code sections
- Assist in iterative debugging to find root causes

## How to Use

To use the Debugging Agent, provide error messages, stacktraces, or describe the issue you're facing. You can also reference specific functions or files using the `@` symbol. Here are some example prompts:

1. "I'm getting a 401 unauthorized error from @update_document API, help me debug"
2. "Why am I getting this error? Stacktrace: [paste your stacktrace here]"
3. "Help me fix the TypeError in this line `query.lower().split()` of @query_vector_store"

## Best Practices

- Provide as much context as possible, including error messages and stacktraces
- Use the `@` symbol to reference specific functions or files in your codebase
- Follow the agent's suggestions step by step, providing feedback on the results

By leveraging the Debugging with Knowledge Graph Agent, you can streamline your debugging process and quickly identify and resolve issues in your codebase.
