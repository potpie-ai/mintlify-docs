**Custom agents** access specialized tools across eight categories: **Knowledge Graph**, **Code Query**, **Code Changes**, **Integration**, **Web**, **Execution**, **Task Management**, and **Requirements**. Assign tools per task at agent creation to control what the agent can access during execution.

## Tool Categories

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Knowledge Graph | Query and traverse the codebase by node, tag, name, or semantic meaning |
| Code Query | Retrieve file contents, directory structures, and analyzed code element breakdowns |
| Code Changes | Manage code modifications through a session-based change tracking system. Available exclusively to the Code Agent |
| Integration | Detect code changes between branches and commits |
| Web | Search the web and extract content from external URLs |
| Execution | Run read-only shell commands against the repository |
| Task Management | Track and manage work items within the current agent session |
| Requirements | Store and retrieve session-level requirements and constraints |
