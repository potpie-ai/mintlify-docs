# Codebase Q&A Agent

The Codebase Q&A Agent specializes in answering questions about your codebase using the knowledge graph and code analysis tools. This agent can provide insights into various aspects of your code, from specific functions to overall architecture.

## Capabilities

- Answer questions about code functionality and implementation
- Explain how specific features or processes work in your codebase
- Provide information about code structure and architecture
- Provide code snippets and examples to illustrate answers

## How to Use

To use the Codebase Q&A Agent, simply ask questions about your codebase. You can also use the `@` symbol followed by a function or file name to provide a specific entry point for the agent. Here are some example prompts:

1. "Explain how a document is inserted into the database?"
2. "Explain how authorization is implemented in the codebase."
3. "What does the @create_document function do?"
4. "List all the `exercise` related API paths in the codebase"

## Best Practices

- Be specific in your questions to get more accurate and detailed answers
- Use the `@` symbol to reference specific functions or files when asking about particular code elements
- Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific aspects of the codebase

By leveraging the Codebase Q&A Agent, you can quickly gain insights into your codebase, understand complex implementations, and improve your overall knowledge of the project structure.
