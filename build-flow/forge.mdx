**Forge** is Potpie's **specification driven development** environment. Engineers define the desired outcome, constraints, and system boundaries before generation begins. Forge translates those specifications into implementation with full awareness of what already exists in the repository.

## Specification first

Before generating anything, Forge asks for:

- The desired outcome and scope
- Constraints and invariants the implementation must satisfy
- System boundaries and interface definitions
- Failure modes and validation strategies

This shifts the work from writing code to reasoning about system behavior. Agents handle the implementation once the **specification** is locked.

## Repository context

Forge reads the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> for established abstraction layers, dependency direction rules, naming conventions, shared domain models, and prior architectural decisions. When introducing new functionality, Forge:

- Reuses existing abstractions
- Avoids duplicating domain logic
- Respects dependency boundaries
- Aligns with current error handling and testing patterns

Forge generates code with full repository context, so it integrates cleanly.
