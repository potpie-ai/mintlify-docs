Potpie reads existing patterns, conventions, and dependencies from the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> before writing a line of code. It maps the request against what already exists, generates a **specification** and architecture plan, and presents every change as a reviewable **diff**. Code reaches the repository only after diff approval.

## Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the feature">
    Enter a description of the feature to build. Potpie asks clarifying questions before generating anything.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Clarifying questions">
    Potpie surfaces a set of clarifying questions as multiple choice options. Answers lock in the scope and requirements before the specification begins.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Specification">
    Potpie parses the codebase against the confirmed requirements and generates a specification covering every file to create or modify, implementation details for each change, and dependency relationships between affected components.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Plan">
    Once the spec is confirmed, Potpie generates a plan across three tabs:

    | Tab | Contents |
    |---|---|
    | Summary | Written description of what will be built and how it fits the existing system |
    | Architecture | Visual map of component relationships across client, API, and data layers |
    | Plan items | Each task with the files to create or modify and verification criteria |

    <img src="/images/code-agent-plan-architecture.png" alt="Architecture tab" />

    <img src="/images/code-agent-plan-items.png" alt="Plan items tab" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code generation">
    Potpie generates the code and presents every change as a **diff**. Every modification appears at the file and line level before anything reaches the codebase. Changes match the existing code style and conventions identified during **specification**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull request">
    Clicking **Create PR** pushes the full diff to the repository.

  </Step>

## Multi-agent mode

Potpie runs in two modes depending on request complexity:

- **Single agent:** Potpie handles the full request from start to finish.
- **Multi agent:** Potpie's subagents can do research as well as coding.

Potpie determines the mode automatically.

## Using the API

The <a href="/api-reference/endpoint/create-conversation-and-message" className="mode-link">Create Conversation and Message</a> endpoint opens a session against a <a href="/concepts/parsing" className="mode-link">parsed</a> project and returns the specification and plan in a single call.
