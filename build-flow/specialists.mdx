title: 'Specialists'
---

**Specialists** are Potpie's purpose-built agents for specific engineering tasks. Each agent is scoped to a single function and built with **structured prompting**, tool integrations, predefined skills, controlled memory, and **evaluation loops**. Agents produce testable, measurable, and reproducible behavior across runs.

## Available specialists

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| <a href="/agents/qna-agent" className="mode-link">Q&A Agent</a> | Retrieves and grounds answers in verified source material across large repositories |
| <a href="/agents/debugging-agent" className="mode-link">Debugging Agent</a> | Traverses service relationships, analyzes diffs, validates contracts, and reproduces failures in sandboxed environments |
| <a href="/agents/code-changes-agent" className="mode-link">Code Agent</a> | Generates implementation ready code changes with full awareness of repository structure, patterns, and dependencies |

## Model compatibility

Specialists run consistently across **foundation model** variants. As models improve, agents inherit those improvements and workflows stay unchanged. The orchestration layer standardizes response structure, execution patterns, and task level evaluation criteria, so output consistency holds across model variants.

## Composability

Specialists can be orchestrated together while preserving precision and traceability. They integrate with existing tooling, respect access controls, and produce outputs that hold up in demanding engineering workflows.
