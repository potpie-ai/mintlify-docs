Two questions every engineer asks when joining or extending a codebase.

## Pattern Check

Ask how a pattern is applied across the repository to find where it holds and where it breaks.

```text
How is error handling implemented across all API routes?
Where is the repository pattern used and where is it bypassed?
Which services follow the event-driven pattern and which call each other directly?
```

## Duplication Scan

Ask before building to find existing implementations and avoid writing logic that already exists.

```text
Is there existing logic for rate limiting before I write my own?
Where else is email validation implemented in this codebase?
Find all places that parse JWT tokens.
```
