The **Debug Agent** traces a reported issue from where it surfaces to where it originates. It walks the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> across every affected component, pins the **root cause** to an exact file and line, and returns a targeted fix.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the issue">
    Paste an error message, stack trace, or describe the unexpected behavior. Include any context about when it occurs.

    <Tip>
      Follow up messages within the same session retain full context. Start with a high-level symptom and narrow to the root cause across subsequent turns.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Potpie investigates">
    The **Debug Agent** applies its **eight step methodology** automatically: validating the behavior, traversing code paths, pinning the **root cause**, and generating a targeted fix.

</Steps>

## Eight-step methodology

Potpie applies an **eight step methodology** to every issue:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand and validate">
    Confirms the reported behavior against the codebase, identifies every component involved, and establishes what the correct behavior should be at the point of failure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore and hypothesize">
    Traverses the relevant code paths in the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> and generates candidate explanations for the failure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify the root cause">
    Pins the failure to a specific file and line, identifying the exact instruction that introduces the faulty state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generalize the issue">
    Checks whether the same defect pattern appears elsewhere in the codebase.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design a solution">
    Generates a targeted fix scoped to the **root cause**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scrutinize and refine">
    Evaluates the fix against edge cases and traces potential side effects through the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">dependency graph</a>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement">
    Produces the corrected code with exact file paths and line references.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final verification">
    Validates the fix against the original failure and checks for regressions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Investigation mode

Potpie resolves straightforward issues end to end. For failures that span multiple services or require deep dependency traversal, Potpie delegates to specialized subagents.

## Using the API

The <a href="/api-reference/endpoint/create-conversation-and-message" className="mode-link">Create Conversation and Message</a> endpoint opens a debug session against a parsed project and returns the first investigation response in a single call.
