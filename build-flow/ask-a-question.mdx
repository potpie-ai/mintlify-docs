title: 'Ask'
---

**Ask** answers natural language questions about the codebase. It queries the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> using <a href="/concepts/inference" className="mode-link">inference</a> to surface relationships, flows, and patterns. When a query involves a third-party library or external API, Ask retrieves the relevant documentation via **web fetch**.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask your question">
    Type a natural language question about the codebase. **Ask** handles **flow tracing**, **dependency mapping**, and **pattern analysis**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the response">
    Potpie returns an answer with exact file paths and line references for every claim.

    <Tip>
      Follow up questions in the same session retain full context, so **Ask** can narrow from a broad overview to a specific function without re-establishing context.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

## Question types

| Type | Response |
|---|---|
| Tracing flows | Full component sequence from entry point to output, with file paths and line references at each step |
| Mapping dependencies | Every class, function, and module that imports or calls the target, organized by dependency type |
| Pattern analysis | Every instance of the pattern across the codebase with code citations |

## Using the API

The <a href="/api-reference/endpoint/create-conversation-and-message" className="mode-link">Create Conversation and Message</a> endpoint opens a session against a <a href="/concepts/parsing" className="mode-link">parsed</a> project and returns a cited, markdown formatted answer in a single call.
