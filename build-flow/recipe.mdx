**Recipe** is Potpie's **workflow orchestration** layer for coordinating agents in production. Engineers describe a Recipe in natural language, and Potpie translates it into a structured execution plan with defined **agent sequencing**, **retry policies**, **state management**, and **failure handling**. Each execution maintains **state** across steps, so Potpie can retry or resume partial failures from the point of failure.

## Triggers

| Trigger | When it runs |
|---|---|
| Scheduled | Time based execution on defined intervals via cron expressions or calendar schedules |
| Event driven | Repository changes, incident alerts, deployment events, or external system signals |
| Conditional | Adapts at runtime based on the outcome of prior steps or external conditions |

## Composability

Recipes orchestrate both predefined Potpie agents and custom agents:

- **Predefined agents** bring structured capabilities for code analysis, debugging, validation, Q&A, and deployment checks
- **Custom agents** handle domain specific logic or internal business rules

## Integrations

Recipes connect across source control, CI/CD pipelines, observability platforms, ticketing systems, cloud infrastructure APIs, and internal data services. Potpie provides predefined, standardized integrations, so workflows span systems through built-in connections.
