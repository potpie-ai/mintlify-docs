## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the PotpieAI integration for Slack, you need:

1. A PotpieAI account with an API token
2. At least one project that has been parsed and is in "ready" status
3. The PotpieAI app for Slack installed in your workspace

### Installation

1. Add the PotpieAI app for Slack to your workspace by clicking [here](https://potpie-slack-1060968446103.asia-south1.run.app/slack/install)
2. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted
3. Once installed, you'll see PotpieAI in your Slack workspace's apps list

## Authentication

Before you can start using PotpieAI in Slack, you need to authenticate with your API token:

1. Type `/authenticate` in any channel or direct message
2. A modal will open asking for your API token
3. Enter your PotpieAI API token (follow [api access documentation](https://docs.potpie.ai/agents/api-access) to generate your token)
4. Click "Submit"

You'll receive a confirmation message once authenticated successfully.

## Using PotpieAI in Slack

### Starting a Conversation

To start a conversation with a PotpieAI agent:

1. Type `/potpie` in any channel or direct message
2. A modal will open with the following options:
   - Repository selection (choose from your parsed repositories)
   - Agent selection (choose which AI agent to use)
   - Query input (ask your initial question)
3. Fill in all fields and click "Submit"

PotpieAI will create a new thread with your query and respond with an answer based on your codebase.

### Continuing the Conversation

To continue an existing conversation:

1. Reply to the thread by @mentioning PotpieAI (e.g., `@PotpieAI tell me more about this function`)
2. The agent will process your follow-up question within the context of the ongoing conversation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "You haven't authenticated yet" message  
**Solution**: Use the `/authenticate` command to set up your API token

**Issue**: "You don't have any ready projects" message  
**Solution**: Go to the PotpieAI dashboard and parse your repository first
