If you have a `.vsix` file:

2. Go to Extensions view
3. Click the `...` menu → **Install from VSIX...**
4. Select the `potpie-vscode-extension.vsix` file

**Command Line Installation:**

code --install-extension potpie-vscode-extension.vsix
```

## Requirements

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign In

After installing the extension:

1. Click the Potpie icon in the Activity Bar (sidebar)
2. Click **Sign In** in the chat panel
3. Your default browser opens to the Potpie authentication page
4. Complete the sign-in process
5. Return to VS Code. You're now authenticated

The extension maintains your session across VS Code restarts.

### 2. Select a Project

1. Open a workspace that corresponds to a parsed Potpie project
2. The extension automatically detects the repository
3. If you have multiple projects, select one from the chat interface

### 3. Start Chatting

1. Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+L` / `Cmd+Shift+L` to focus the chat
2. Type your question or request in the input box
3. The AI agent analyzes your codebase and responds
4. Continue the conversation naturally

**Example Questions:**
- "Where is user authentication implemented?"
- "Explain how the database connection works"
- "Add error handling to the login function"
- "Show me all API endpoints in this project"

## Tunnel Connection

The extension establishes a secure tunnel between your local VS Code and Potpie's cloud infrastructure.

### How It Works

1. **Local Server:** Runs on port 8010 (configurable) to handle file operations
2. **Tunnel Process:** Creates a secure connection to Potpie's cloud
3. **Registration:** Registers your workspace (repository + branch) with the backend
4. **Execution:** Cloud agents can request local operations through the tunnel

### Connection Status

The status bar shows your tunnel connection state:

- 🔴 **Blinking Red Dot + "Connecting..."**: Tunnel is establishing
- 🟢 **Solid Green Dot + "Online"**: Tunnel is active and registered
- ⚪ **Gray/Hidden**: Not applicable (not signed in or tunnel disabled)

### Manual Restart

If the tunnel disconnects:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run **Potpie: Retry Tunnel Setup**
3. Wait for the green "Online" indicator
