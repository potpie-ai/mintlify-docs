**Trace** is Potpie's **continuous monitoring** layer for distributed systems. It compares live behavior against the service contracts and dependency relationships encoded in the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a>, and activates an analysis when a deviation is detected.

## Impact scoping

Trace uses the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> as an operational specification:

- Traverses the service call graph to assess upstream and downstream impact
- Validates live requests against API and schema contracts defined in code
- Compares current deployment state against historical baselines
- Maps configuration changes to the services they affect
- Estimates **blast radius** before applying a fix

Because component relationships are already encoded in the graph, Trace constrains the scope immediately. When a latency spike appears, Trace evaluates contract compliance, dependency health, scaling policies, and recent configuration diffs in a single pass.

## Root cause analysis

When telemetry falls short of establishing causality, **Trace** builds a **branching analysis tree**. Each branch represents a concrete, testable cause: a configuration regression, contract mismatch, scaling miscalibration, or downstream latency shift.

Trace prioritizes branches by confidence using historical baselines and eliminates weak paths early. Trace validates each cause in an isolated sandbox that reproduces production conditions without affecting live systems.

## Feedback loop

Validated findings feed back into the development workflow. Recurring failure patterns surface earlier. The same class of failures reaches production less often.
