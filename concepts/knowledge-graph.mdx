title: 'Knowledge Graph'
description: 'How Potpie builds a semantic map of your codebase.'

Potpie parses every source file in a connected repository and runs <a href="/concepts/inference" className="mode-link">inference</a> on each node to build a **knowledge graph**, a structured representation of what every component does and how it relates to everything else. **Ask**, **Build**, and **Debug** all run against this graph.

## What gets parsed

Every source file breaks down into typed nodes.

| Node type | What it captures |
|---|---|
| `Function` / `Method` | Signature, parameters, return type, call sites, and the file it lives in |
| `Class` | Fields, methods, inheritance chain, and every file that instantiates or extends it |
| `Module` / `File` | Exports, imports, and the dependency relationships between files |

<Info>
Potpie indexes each branch independently, so queries always reflect the exact state of code on the selected branch.
</Info>

## How relationships are mapped

Relationships between nodes become typed **edges** in the graph.

| Edge type | What it represents |
|---|---|
| `Calls` | A function invoking another function |
| `Imports` | A file or module depending on another |
| `Extends` | A class inheriting from another |
| `Implements` | A class implementing an interface or contract |

<Info>
Every edge carries directionality. The graph records which component depends on which, giving agents a precise map of every dependency in the codebase.
</Info>

## How agents use it

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Ask" href="/build-flow/ask-a-question">
    Traces a flow by traversing edges from the entry point outward.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build" href="/build-flow/build-a-feature">
    Reads dependency edges around every file it plans to modify before generating a spec.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Debug" href="/build-flow/debug-an-issue">
    Follows the call chain backwards from the point of failure to identify a root cause.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Every answer is grounded in the graph. File paths and line numbers come directly from the indexed nodes.
