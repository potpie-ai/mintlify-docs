## Link your repository

When you sign up for Potpie, we ask you to install the [Potpie GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/potpie-ai). This will allow you to select the repositories you'd like to create codebase agents for.
After installing the app, you will be redirected to the dashboard where you can start creating codebase agents. 

## Create your first codebase agent


### Select your repository

On the new chat screen, select the Repository dropdown and select the repository you'd like to use. You also need to select the branch you'd like to use.
This will ensure that your chat has the correct context of the codebase for the agent to answer questions.

## Chat with your codebase agent

Send a message to your agent to get started. You can ask questions, follow up on previous instructions, or ask clarifying questions.

That's it, its that easy! 

You're now ready to start using AI agents to help you with your workflows.
