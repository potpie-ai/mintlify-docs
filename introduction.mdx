## What is Potpie?

Build AI agents for your codebase in minutes. 

Potpie deeply understands your codebase by breaking down your code into its constituting parts and building a knowledge graph out of your code's components. 
We generate inferences at every level of your codebase so that we can comprehensively answer questions about your codebase. 

Potpie provides purpose built agents that are expert on your codebase to perform engineering tasks for you, and also provides the platform for you to build your own custom agents using tools that interface with the knowledge graph.
