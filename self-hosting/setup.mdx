## Firebase

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Firebase project">
    Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a service account key">
    1. Open **Project Overview** from the sidebar
    2. Go to the **Service Accounts** tab
    3. Under **Firebase Admin SDK**, click **Generate new private key**
    4. Confirm the warning, download the key, rename it to `firebase_service_account.json`, and place it in the root of the Potpie source directory
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Portkey

Portkey provides observability and monitoring for AI calls made by Potpie.

Create a free account at [Portkey](https://app.portkey.ai/signup) and add your API key to `.env` as `PORTKEY_API_KEY`.

## GitHub App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the app">
    Visit [GitHub App Creation](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) and choose a name relevant to Potpie (e.g. `potpie-auth`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set permissions">
    | Scope | Permission |
    |---|---|
    | Repository Contents | Read only |
    | Repository Metadata | Read only |
    | Repository Pull requests | Read and write |
    | Repository Secrets | Read only |
    | Repository Webhooks | Read only |
    | Organization Members | Read only |
    | Account Email address | Read only |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add credentials to env">
    Generate a private key, download it, and add it to `.env` as `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`. Add the app ID as `GITHUB_APP_ID`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the app">
    From the left sidebar, select **Install App** and install it on the organization or user account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## GitHub Auth on Firebase

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable GitHub sign-in">
    In Firebase, go to **Authentication** and enable the GitHub sign-in provider. GitHub provides a client ID and client secret. Add both to Firebase.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the callback URL">
    Copy the callback URL from Firebase and paste it into the GitHub App settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Google Cloud

Potpie uses Google Secret Manager to store API keys. Creating a Firebase project automatically links a Google Cloud account. Use that or create a new one.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Secret Manager">
    Enable the Secret Manager API for the Google Cloud project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Application Default Credentials">
    Run the following to authenticate locally:

    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

    Alternatively, place the GCP service account key file at `service-account.json` in the root of the codebase.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running Potpie

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Docker">
    Verify Docker is installed and running.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure environment">
    Create a `.env` file from the provided `.env.template` in the repository and fill in all required values.
