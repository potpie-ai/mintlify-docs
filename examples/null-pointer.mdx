title: 'Null Pointer'
description: 'Trace a null pointer exception to its origin across service and data layers.'
---

A null pointer exception surfacing in a generic service layer shows where the crash happens, while the null value originates elsewhere. Tracing it backwards through multiple service and data layers manually leaves the true origin uncertain.

**Debug** traces the full execution path through the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> from the point of failure back to the source, identifies exactly where the null value enters without a guard, and returns a targeted fix.

**Issue:**
```
Users are getting null pointer errors during checkout with empty carts.
```

**Potpie traces:**
1. The checkout controller that receives the request
2. The cart service and how it handles empty state
3. The downstream order service that fails on null cart data

**Root cause citation:**
- Exact file path and line where the null value passes through without a null check
- The dependent call site that throws the exception

**Fix includes:**
- Null guard at the correct layer with the minimal change required
- Verification across all call sites for the same missing check

<a href="/build-flow/build-a-feature" className="mode-link">**Build**</a> generates the corrected code as a reviewable **diff**.
