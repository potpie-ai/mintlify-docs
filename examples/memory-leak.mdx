title: 'Memory Leak'
description: 'Trace a memory leak in a long running service to its source across object lifecycle and dependency chains.'
---

A long running service degrading over time rarely points to the leak in its stack trace. Heap growth across requests can originate in a cache, an event listener, a retained reference, or a closure hiding across multiple files and layers.

**Debug** traces **object lifecycle** and retention patterns across the codebase through the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a>, identifies exactly what holds in memory and why, and returns a targeted fix at the source.

**Issue:**
```
The background worker service crashes after several hours due to out-of-memory errors.
```

**Potpie traces:**
1. The background worker and its request handling loop
2. Objects allocated per request and whether they release properly
3. Any caches, listeners, or references that accumulate across requests

**Root cause citation:**
- Exact file and line where objects persist beyond their lifecycle
- The reference chain preventing garbage collection

**Fix includes:**
- Corrected object lifecycle management at the source
- Assessment of whether the same retention pattern exists elsewhere in the service

<a href="/build-flow/build-a-feature" className="mode-link">**Build**</a> generates the corrected code as a reviewable **diff**.
