title: 'API Endpoint'
description: 'Add a new endpoint with full dependency awareness and matching code style.'
---

Adding an endpoint with unmapped routing conventions, middleware requirements, and error handling patterns produces code that works in isolation but breaks consistency across the API. Surfacing these gaps before writing a line prevents them from reaching review.

**Build** analyzes the full codebase through the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> before generating anything, producing a **specification**, architecture plan, and **diff** that matches existing patterns exactly.

**Request:**
```
Add a user profile endpoint to the API
```

**Build produces:**
- A specification listing every file to create or modify
- An architecture tab showing where the new endpoint fits in the existing layer structure
- Plan items with exact file paths and verification criteria for each change

**Code generation includes:**
- Route definition matching existing routing conventions
- Controller with error handling consistent with other endpoints
- Any middleware or validation required by the existing pattern

The **diff** appears at the file and line level before PR creation. <a href="/build-flow/build-a-feature#pull-request" className="mode-link">Create the PR</a> directly from the **diff** view.
