title: 'Code Migration'
description: 'Migrate a module to a new pattern with full dependency awareness.'
---

Migrating a module to a new pattern requires knowing every file that needs to change before starting. A change that appears isolated often touches dozens of consumers, interfaces, and tests across layers.

**Build** reads the existing module through the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a>, maps every dependent service and interface, and generates a **specification** listing every file to create or modify before a line of code is written.

**Request:**
```
Migrate the payment module from REST to GraphQL
```

**Build maps:**
- Every service that consumes the current module's interface
- Every contract or type definition that needs to change
- Every test that covers the existing behavior

**Code generation includes:**
- Updated module implementing the new pattern
- Adjusted consumers with matching interface changes
- Modified tests reflecting the new contract

The complete change set appears as a **diff** before PR creation. <a href="/build-flow/build-a-feature#pull-request" className="mode-link">Create the PR</a> directly from the **diff** view.
