description: 'Map every dependency before touching a core service.'
---

Modifying a core service with unknown dependencies turns a contained change into a cascade of broken builds. Most teams spend hours manually tracing call chains across files before proceeding.

**Ask** traverses the <a href="/concepts/knowledge-graph" className="mode-link">knowledge graph</a> outward from the target service using the Node Neighbors tool, mapping every dependent function, class, and module across the repository. The response lists each dependency with its exact file path and line number. Full **blast radius**, before touching a single line.

**Question:**
```
What depends on PaymentService and what breaks if I change its interface?
```

**Ask returns:**
- Every class, function, and module that calls or imports `PaymentService`
- Each call site with its exact file path and line number
- Transitive dependencies that would be affected by an interface change

<a href="/build-flow/build-a-feature" className="mode-link">**Build**</a> uses the same dependency map to generate a spec and diff across every affected file.
