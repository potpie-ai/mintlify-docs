---

CrewAI's framework opens up fascinating possibilities for building AI agents. While exploring its features, I found myself wanting to dive deeper into how everything works under the hood. The documentation is great for getting started, but there's something exciting about understanding the inner workings of how something works. The docs are great for getting started, but when you need to understand the nitty-gritty of a feature - things can get complicated.

## A Better Way to explore the CrewAI codebase

Potpie provides focused agents that understand a codebase and provide functionalities like Q\&A, Debugging, System Design etc. We can use Potpie’s Q\&A codebase to understand CrewAI’s codebase better. Potpie is open-source tool and uses CrewAI agents itself to help you understand the codebase better. Here's what it actually does:

When you ask about a feature (like "how does training work in CrewAI?"), Potpie:

* Looks at the actual implementation in the codebase

* Shows you the relevant code files and their relationships

* Explains how different components work together

* Points out important implementation details you might miss

## A Real Example

Let's say you're trying to figure out CrewAI's training system. Instead of jumping between different files on GitHub, figuring out which ones are relevant, you can just ask Potpie. It'll show you:

* The main components (train\_crew.py and training\_handler.py)

* How the execution flow works

* Where training data gets stored

* How error handling is implemented

The best part? You're looking at the actual implementation, not just documentation.

**When This Really Helps**
This approach is particularly useful when you're:

* Trying to debug an issue with a specific feature

* Planning to contribute to CrewAI

* Building something that needs to interact with CrewAI's internals

* Just curious about how things work under the hood

## Steps to use Potpie to ask questions about CrewAI:

1. Navigate to [app.potpie.ai](https://app.potpie.ai/newchat?repo=crewAIInc/crewAI\&branch=main)

2. Click on the “Parse” button

3. Select the Codebase Q\&A Agent and start asking questions!
