description: "How to use the Q&A Agent to understand the AgentOps-AI/AgentStack codebase"
---

AgentStack's framework provides powerful capabilities for building AI agents. While exploring its features, I found myself wanting to dive deeper into how certain features work under the hood. Iâ€™ve often found that there's something exciting about understanding the inner workings of how something works.

**A Better Way to Explore the AgentStack Codebase**

Potpie provides specialized agents that comprehensively understand codebases and offer functionalities like Q\&A, Debugging, and System Design analysis. We can leverage Potpie's Q\&A capability to gain deeper insights into AgentStack's implementation. Potpie is an open-source tool that utilizes agents to help developers better understand codebases. Here's how it functions:

When you inquire about a feature (like "How does mem0 integration work in AgentStack?"), Potpie:

* Analyzes the actual implementation in the codebase

* Presents relevant code files and their interconnections

* Explains the interaction between different components

* Highlights crucial implementation details that might be overlooked

**A Real Example**

Let's examine how AgentStack integrates with mem0. Instead of manually searching through GitHub repositories and determining relevant files, you can simply ask Potpie. It reveals:

* The core configuration (agentstack/tools/mem0.json)

* How memory operations are implemented (write\_to\_memory and read\_from\_memory functions)

* The integration with Neo4j for storage

* The authentication and environment variable setup process

The most valuable aspect is that you're examining the actual implementation rather than just documentation descriptions.

**When This Really Helps**

This approach proves particularly valuable when:

* Debugging feature specific issues in your agents

* Planning to contribute to AgentStack

* Developing applications that need to interface with a particular AgentStack system

* Understanding the underlying architecture
